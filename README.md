<i>Keywords: random forest, decision tree, prediction</i>

This project provides a Java implementation of random forests [1, 2]. Random
forests use training sets to build decision trees. Given an input (e.g. a person
with age, gender, medical background, symptoms) the result (e.g. a disease) of
which is unknown, random forests are able to predict the corresponding result.

## API
